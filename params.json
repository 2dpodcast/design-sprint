This template helps alleviate some of the initial setup\r\nfor the board and leaves references to this repo.\r\n\r\nCopy [this template](https://trello.com/b/lMmuSlkP/public-design-sprint-template) \r\nto your own board to help guide and document your sprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Design Sprint Schedule\r\n\r\n* [Schedule for Understand](1-Understand/Schedule.md)\r\n* [Schedule for Diverge](2-Diverge/Schedule.md)\r\n* [Schedule for Converge](3-Converge/Schedule.md)\r\n* [Schedule for Prototype](4-Prototype/Schedule.md)\r\n* [Schedule for Test](5-Test/Schedule.md)\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\n* [thoughtbot's blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint)\r\n* [thoughtbot playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/#product-design-sprint)\r\n* Google Ventures [Design Staff blog posts](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2012-10-02.html)\r\n  * [Before the sprint: Prepare](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-2-2012-10-09.html)\r\n  * [Day 1: Understand](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-day-1-understand-2012-10-16.html)\r\n  * [Day 2: Diverge](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-day-2-diverge-2012-10-26.html)\r\n  * [Day 3: Decide](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-day-3-decide-2012-11-20.html)\r\n  * [Day 4: Prototype](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-day-4-prototype-2013-01-07.html)\r\n  * [Day 5: Validate](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/product-design-sprint-day-5-validate-2013-03-07.html)\r\n* IDEO's [Human Centered Design Toolkit](http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/)\r\n* [How To Conduct Your Own Google Ventures Design Sprint](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672887/how-to-conduct-your-own-google-design-sprint)\r\n* [Personal Design Sprint](http://franciscortez.com/design-sprint/)\r\n* [Gamestorming](http://www.amazon.com/Gamestorming-Playbook-Innovators-Rulebreakers-Changemakers/dp/0596804172) and the [Gamestorming Wiki](http://www.gamestorming.com/the-wiki/)\r\n* [Good Kickoff Meetings](http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/)\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe love new ideas that push this repository and design sprints forward.
