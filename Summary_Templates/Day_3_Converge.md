# Converge: Choose the Right Path
On day three of the design sprint our goal is to take all of the possibilities
that we have exposed over the past two days and hone in on a single version of
the prototype that we will build tomorrow.

[Example: “Because Great Engagements is an entirely new product, considering a
customer’s first encounter and reaction to the product is very important in
terms of understanding positioning and how to successfully communicate with
potential customers. From all of the discovery we have done over the past two
days, we feel strongly about differentiating ourselves in the market by
capturing the customer with an emotional and inspirational AirBnb like venue
discovery experience.

To test if we can successfully do this, we decided on a very image heavy
layout that suggests beautiful wedding themes and experiences to get the
potential customer thinking aspirationally about their wedding experience.
We also decided to preset the potential customer with a madlib style venue
search form that we hope will encourage the customer to get excited about
starting the discovery process.”]

# The Prototype Storyboard
[Pictures of final storyboard]


# The Assumptions
[Identify all the assumptions that are built into the prototype and identify
how you will address each assumption (research, testing etc).]

#Questions for Prototype Validation
Example:
- Do people engage with mad lib?
- Will they attempt to click into and fill it out?
- Will they say anything about it?
- Is there a “wow” factor on the home page?
- Look for facial expressions.
- Do they make any comments? (“ahh!”, “I like this!”)
- Do they attempt to click into themes?
- Do they get that the site is about venue discovery?
