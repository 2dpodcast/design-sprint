# Understand: Gather existing knowledge, expose assumptions and unknowns

Day one of the design sprint is about gathering all existing information/knowledge on the business, the customer and the problem and exposing our assumptions and knowledge gaps. From here can make plans to fill the riskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate our riskiest assumptions.


### Design Sprint Documents:

[link to folder with docs]

In this folder you will find documents that, to best of our abilities:

* Define the business
* Define the Customer
* Define the problem & Value prop
* Capture our assumptions and unknowns
* Define context specific terms
* Capture our analysis of competitive products and google Adword analytics
* Gather inspirational and informative resources
* Gather existing research


### Going forward:
Example: “Because Great Engagements is an entirely new product, considering a customer’s first encounter and reaction to the product is very important in terms of understanding how to properly position the product and successfully communicate with potential customers. Secondly, we need to validate that our value prop is actually valuable to the customers in the market we want to service. Given these insights, we have decided to create prototypes that will test our hypothesis on how best to engage a new customer. And if we have time, a prototype of a venue page that provides the experiences and information solutions that are a core part of our initial value prop hypothesis.”
