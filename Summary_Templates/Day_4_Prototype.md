# The Prototype

[Example and summary of prototype]

The Prototype: http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/

Example: “Our prototype is much higher-fidelity than a prototype would typically be, but that was somewhat necessary for testing our hypothesis.”

### The primary assumption
Example: “We can create an engaging, exciting and emotional experience that gets people fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high quality information.

Some of the biggest influences on the prototype were AirBnb and Urban Compass.”
