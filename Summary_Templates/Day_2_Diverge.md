# Diverge: illuminating all possible paths

Day two of the design sprint is about generating insights and solution concepts. Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

### The most important user story

The user story that is most important for this sprint or that best addresses our most blocking/risky assumptions/knowledge gaps. (Write the story as if you were the ‘user’)

“[the user story you identified]” - Potential Customer

### What’s the goal of the prototype?

[Explain the core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions we are trying to validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps we are trying to fill.]

Example: “Before couples can address the details of planning a wedding (decoration, guests, caterers, dress, etc.), couples usually have to decide on a location and venue. The couple is filled with excitement; as the wedding day will usher forth a new life for the couple together. However, the couple might experience a bit of uncertainty as to how even to proceed planning their wedding. We want to capture couples at their “excitement” period and put aside all uncertainty and potential anxiety that the wedding planning process may cause. A customer’s initial engagement with our website should parallel his/her engagement with the wedding process in general. 

With our prototype, we want to evaluate our ability to capture the excitement of a recently engaged person and leverage that excitement to create engagement with our website.”
