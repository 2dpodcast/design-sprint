## Day 1: Understand

### Part 1: (2hrs)

#### Intro to the design sprint (5min)

There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a design sprint is about quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to solve problems.

For kicking off a new venture or product the initial design sprint is about orienting the team and aiming our efforts so that we can be confident that we are heading in the right direction. Integrating design thinking into our product development process and utilizing design sprints along the way will keep us on target and make sure we investing our time and money wisely.

#### The Process
High Level overview and goals of each day. Set expectations about how we might feel at certain steps in the process.

#### The challenge statement (10min)
Define a concise design challenge. “A Design Challenge is phrased in a human-centered way with a sense of possibility. For example: ‘Create savings and investment products that are appropriate for people living in rural areas.’” - IDEO HCD toolkit

#### Intro to Day 1: Understand, guidelines, risks and back-burner boards (5min)
Day 1 is about developing a common understanding of the context  within which we are working and all the elements in that context (the problem, the business, the customer, the value prop/hypothesis, success, etc). Our goal is to expose risky knowledge gaps and identify risky assumptions so that we can make plans for reducing those risks and move forward confident we are heading in the right direction. Also, by gather info we will empower our decision making abilities and eliminate the need for guesswork later on.

#### Guidelines
Ask obvious questions and embrace the beginners mind. “Shoshin(初心) is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's mind". It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner in that subject would.”

#### Risks board
Throughout the day and rest of the week we will ask questions we don’t have answers to and identify assumptions we are relying on. We will capture these ‘risks’ on a sticky note board for later organization and analysis.

#### Back-burner board
We will also be generating a lot of ideas throughout the week. Some of the ideas will be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, won’t be. We will capture these good but not immediately relevant ‘back-burner ideas’ on a sticky note board.

#### Team intros (15min)
Introduce the design sprint team, determine the “decider” and acknowledge the others involved with the project but not participating in the design sprint.

#### Pitch Practice (15min)
[See pitch practice worksheet]

#### Existing research (10min)
Quickly identify existing research the client has done and determine when that research can be brought back during the definitions section of the day.

#### Definitions: The business & The customer (1hr)
[See the business and the customer worksheets]

### Part 2: (2hrs)

#### Definitions: The problem, The value prop, Success (1hr)
[See the problem & the value prop and success worksheets]

#### Business Model Canvas (30min)
[See business model canvas worksheets]

#### Analytics (Google Adwords) (30min)

### Part 3: (2hrs)

#### Lightning Demos (45min)
Analyze three or more competitive or similar products.

#### Expert Perspectives (30min)
Identify existing research and other perspectives that would provide valuable insights and info.

#### Layout Screens (45min)

#### Daily Recap (30min)
Consolidate notes and write daily summary.

## Day 2: Diverge

### Part 1: (2hrs)

#### Intro to Day 2: Diverge, guidelines (5min)
Day two of the design sprint is about generating insights and solution concepts. Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

#### Guidelines
Everyone participates, you don’t need to be an artist (I’m not!) to sketch and visualize your ideas. No ideas are to wild!

#### Pitch Practice (10min)

#### Recap Day 1, identify biggest risks, determine goals for the prototype (45min)**

#### Identify and diagram the critical path for the prototype (45min)
Write down the user story that is most important for this sprint or that best addresses our most blocking/risky assumptions/knowledge gaps. (Write the story as if you were the ‘user’). Diagram the critical path, and break it into pieces if necessary for the purpose of the iteration exercises. 

#### Mind Map (15min)
Create a "cheat sheet" of notes to use in later ideation exercises.

### Part 2: (2hrs)

#### Crazy Eights (10min x2)

#### Storyboard (20min)

#### Silent critique (10min)

#### 3min critiques (3-5min each person)

### Part 3 (2hrs):
Repeat Part 2 for the same user story or a different segment of
the same story.

#### Daily Recap (30min)
Consolidate notes and write daily summary.

## Day 3: Converge

### Part 1: (2hrs)

#### Intro to Day 3: Converge, guidelines (5min)
On day three of the design sprint our goal is to take all of the possibilities that we have exposed over the past two days and hone in on a single version of the prototype that we will build tomorrow.

#### Pitch Practice (10min)

#### Revisit our risks (15min)

#### Recap Day 2, identify themes from our storyboards (30min)

#### Identify conflicts in our storyboards (30min)
Conflict: two or more ways of solving the same problem.

#### List the underlying assumptions (30min)
Create a table with two columns. One listing the assumptions embedded in our prototype and the other listing the ways in which we can test those assumptions.

### Part 2: (2hrs)

#### Storyboard your prototype (2hrs)

### Part 3: (2hrs)

#### Determine prototype medium (10min)
