[Summary: reactions to competitive demos, our assumptions for the prototype,
what we were looking for and the reactions to the prototype] 

Example: “Connie supplied us with three interviewees (2 were done online, 1 in
person; 1 was recently married). Though the dataset was limited due to the
background and interest of those we interviewed, we gained some important
insight to help us build a superior wedding planning product. People’s
complaints about competing wedding sites, such as The Knot, Wedding Wire, and
Offbeat Bride, were about the lack of focus on those websites (too disorganized,
too much information). They were most engaged by browsing things like wedding
dresses, cakes  etc.

While it is important for any newly engaged person to gain access to important
information about the wedding planning process, some of these websites provided
stress and anxiety as much as they did excitement about the “Big Day.”
Furthermore, while acknowledging that the first step in their processes might be
to contact friends and to think about location, these other websites presented
an overwhelming wealth of information (such as on decoration and wear) that
might be more informative later on in a couple’s wedding planning process after
they have chosen the wedding location and venue.

The primary assumption we were testing for with our prototype was that we will
be able to create an engaging, exciting an emotional experience that gets people
fantasizing about their wedding through images, storytelling and high quality
information. We chose to test for this because we believe that if we can engage
and pull customers into the product in this way, we may be able to more
successfully introduce rational planning, communication tools, and premium
services once they move further down the engagement funnel. Through competitive
analysis we also identified this emotional/aspirational experience as a means of
differentiation in the market.

When shown the Great Engagments Prototype, the users were engaged with the
mad-libs functionality and with the large, eye-catching images that create our
demo website (http://greatengagements.herokuapp.com/). They understood right
away that the website is about venue discovery and their initial emotional
reactions were that of excitement and inspiration, very much the reactions we
were looking for to validate our primary assumption. These results give us
reason to further pursue our concepts of immersive, inspirational and
aspirational exploration of venues that would ultimately lead customers to
revenue-generating activities.”
