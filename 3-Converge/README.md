### Intro to Day 3: Converge, guidelines *(5min)*

On day three of the design sprint our goal is to take all of the possibilities
that we have exposed over the past two days and hone in on a single version of
the prototype that we will build tomorrow.

### Pitch Practice *(10min)*

### Revisit our risks *(15min)*

### Recap Day 2, identify themes from our storyboards *(30min)*

### Identify conflicts in our storyboards *(30min)*

Conflict: two or more ways of solving the same problem.

### List the underlying assumptions *(30min)*

Create a table with two columns. One listing the assumptions embedded in our
prototype and the other listing the ways in which we can test those assumptions.

### Storyboard your prototype *(2hrs)*

### Determine prototype medium *(10min)*

### Plan interview questions *(40min)*

### Make plans for reducing risks not addressed by the prototype *(40min)*

### Consider plans for the week following the design sprint *(30min)*

### Daily Recap *(30min)*

Consolidate notes and write daily summary.

## Case Study

> Because Great Engagements is an entirely new product, considering a customerâ€™s
> first encounter and reaction to the product is very important in terms of
> understanding positioning and how to successfully communicate with potential
> customers. From all of the discovery we have done over the past two days, we
> feel strongly about differentiating ourselves in the market by capturing the
> customer with an emotional and inspirational AirBnb like venue discovery
> experience.

> To test if we can successfully do this, we decided on a very image heavy
> layout that suggests beautiful wedding themes and experiences to get the
> potential customer thinking aspirationally about their wedding experience. We
> also decided to preset the potential customer with a madlib style venue search
> form that we hope will encourage the customer to get excited about starting
> the discovery process.
