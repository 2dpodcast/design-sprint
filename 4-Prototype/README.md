# Prototype: Quickly build the right path

---

## Objectives for Prototype
Explain the core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions we are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps we are trying to fill.

> Before couples can address the details of planning a wedding
(decoration, guests, caterers, dress, etc.), couples usually have to decide on a
location and venue. The couple is filled with excitement; as the wedding day
will usher forth a new life for the couple together. However, the couple might
experience a bit of uncertainty as to how even to proceed planning their
wedding. We want to capture couples at their “excitement” period and put aside
all uncertainty and potential anxiety that the wedding planning process may
cause. A customer’s initial engagement with our website should parallel his/her
engagement with the wedding process in general.

> With our prototype, we want to evaluate our ability to capture the excitement of
a recently engaged person and leverage that excitement to create engagement with
our website.

## Case Study for Prototype

> Our prototype is much higher-fidelity than a prototype would typically be, but
> that was somewhat necessary for testing our hypothesis.
