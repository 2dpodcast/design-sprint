## The Design Sprint
There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a
design sprint is about quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to
solve problems.

For kicking off a new venture or product the initial design sprint is about
orienting the team and aiming our efforts so that we can be confident that we
are heading in the right direction. Integrating design thinking into our product
development process and utilizing design sprints along the way will keep us on
target and make sure we investing our time and money wisely.

## Overview

A design sprint can last any length of time but typically consists of five phases,
each lasting one day for a total sprint length of five days.

### Day 1: Understand

Day one is about developing a common understanding of the context  within which we
are working and all the elements in that context (the problem, the business,
the customer, the value prop/hypothesis, success, etc). Our goal is to expose
risky knowledge gaps and identify risky assumptions so that we can make plans
for reducing those risks and move forward confident we are heading in the
right direction. Also, by gather info we will empower our decision making
abilities and eliminate the need for guesswork later on.

### Day 2: Diverge (Ideate)

Day two of the design sprint is about generating insights and solution concepts.
Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how
realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of
opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically
different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights
can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution
inspiration.

### Day 3: Converge

On day three of the design sprint our goal is to take all of the possibilities
that we have exposed over the past two days and hone in on a single version
of a prototype that we will build and test with existing or potential customers.
By eliminating as many options as possible we are given reason to be more
confident in the options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

### Day 4: Prototype

On day four all of our effort is put into developing a prototype that will fill
some of our riskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate or riskiest assumptions.
The medium the prototype is built in should be determined by our time
constraints and learning goals. Paper prototypes, keynote prototypes and very simple static
pages could serves as potential prototype mediums.

### Day 5: Test & Validate

Day five is the day we get to test our prototype with existing or potential customers.
By the end of this day we should have validated or invalidated some of our riskiest assumptions
and have a much clearer idea of what steps we need to take next.

## A Guide for Understanding:

As you work through the understand phase of a sprint there will be a lot of
questinos that come up and information that is uncovered.

This is a list of goals and questions that should help keep us on track:

* Develop a common understanding of needs, hopes and aspirations
* Collect stories and inspiration from people
* Conduct field research
* Define and validate the problem you are solving
* Define the vision and the business goals
* Consider desirability: What do people want?
* Consider feasibility: What is technically and organizationally feasible?
* Consider viability: What can be financially viable?
* Recognize existing knowledge (what we already know)
* Identify knowledge gaps (what we don’t know)
* Make plans for filling knowledge gaps
  * Who can we talk to? (experts, customers, etc)li
  * Can we prototype and test something?
* Identify basic assumptions
* Make plans for determining and reducing the risk inherent in our assumptions
* Define success in the context of the current problem.
* Determine success metrics
* Identify sources of inspiration
  * “The simple act of looking at different contexts can bring to
  mind new insights. For example a surgeon can get insights about organizing their
  medical supplies by visiting a hardware store, an airline employer might get
  ideas about check-in by observing a hotel front desk or a water-jug creator
  could observe other ways individuals transport heavy objects or liquids.”
