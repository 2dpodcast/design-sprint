# The Design Sprint 
There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a
design sprint is about quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to
solve problems.

For kicking off a new venture or product the initial design sprint is about
orienting the team and aiming our efforts so that we can be confident that we
are heading in the right direction. Integrating design thinking into our product
development process and utilizing design sprints along the way will keep us on
target and make sure we investing our time and money wisely.

# Some guidelines 
Ask obvious questions and embrace the beginners mind. “Shoshin
(初心) is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's mind". It refers to
having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when
studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner
in that subject would.”
 
# Guide for Understanding: 
* Develop a common understanding of needs, hopes and aspirations 
* Collect stories and inspiration from people 
* Conduct field research
* Define and validate the problem you are solving 
* Define the vision and the business goals 
* Consider desirability: What do people want?  
* Consider feasibility: What is technically and organizationally feasible?  
* Consider viability: What can be financially viable?
* Recognize existing knowledge (what we already know) 
* Identify knowledge gaps (what we don’t know)
* Make plans for filling knowledge gaps 
  * Who can we talk to? (experts, customers, etc)li
  * Can we prototype and test something?  
* Identify basic assumptions
* Make plans for determining and reducing the risk inherent in our assumptions 
* Define success in the context of the current problem.
* Determine success metrics 
* Identify sources of inspiration 
  * “The simple act of looking at different contexts can bring to
  mind new insights. For example a surgeon can get insights about organizing their
  medical supplies by visiting a hardware store, an airline employer might get
  ideas about check-in by observing a hotel front desk or a water-jug creator
  could observe other ways individuals transport heavy objects or liquids.”

# The Team

# The Challenge statement Define a concise design challenge. “A Design Challenge
is phrased in a human-centered way with a sense of possibility. For example:
‘Create savings and investment products that are appropriate for people living
in rural areas.’” - IDEO HCD toolkit,
