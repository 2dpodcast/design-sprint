## Best to use when


## Instructions:
Give everybody a bunch of [dot stickers](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M3SBM2). Then, without speaking, everybody looks at the different storyboards and puts a sticker on every idea or part of an idea they like. There are no limits to how many stickers you can use, and I don’t even prevent people who want to brazenly vote for their own ideas. By the end, you’ve got a kind of heat map, and some ideas are already standing out.
