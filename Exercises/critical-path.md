# Critical Path

**Supplies needed:** Whiteboard, Markers
**Estimated time:** 15 min

## Best to use when

## Instructions:

As a group, use your common understanding to collaboratively map out the user
story that’s important in this sprint. The facilitator (or another volunteer)
should stand at the whiteboard and sketch the flow. This doesn’t have to be
fancy to be useful.

How do you know which user story is most important? It depends on the problem
you are solving in the sprint. For example:

* Helping people understand and get started with your product — you probably
  want to focus on the experience of a user encountering your product for the
  first time.
* Creating a new product concept — you probably want to look into the future and
  imagine the value proposition and core features for an engaged user.
* Improving conversion rate from a landing page — you probably want to
  understand why people land on your page and what their goals are.
* This step can be difficult and time-consuming, but it’s critical!

Getting a visual map on the wall (like the one above) is invaluable for
grounding the discussion and keeping everyone on the same page.
