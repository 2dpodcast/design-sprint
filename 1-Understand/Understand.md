# Understand: Gather existing knowledge, expose assumptions and unknowns
Day one of the design sprint is about gathering all existing information/knowledge on the business, the customer and the problem and exposing our assumptions and knowledge gaps. From here can make plans to fill the riskiest knowledge gaps and validate or invalidate our riskiest assumptions.

## A Guide for Understand:
As you work through the understand phase of a sprint there will be a lot of questions that come up and information that is uncovered.

### Guidelines
Ask obvious questions and embrace the beginners mind. “Shoshin(初心) is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's mind". It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner in that subject would.”

* Develop a common understanding of needs, hopes and aspirations
* Consider desirability: What do people want?
* Consider feasibility: What is technically and organizationally feasible?
* Consider viability: What can be financially viable?
* Recognize existing knowledge (what we already know)
* Identify knowledge gaps (what we don’t know)

## Example Schedule for Understand
### Team intros *(15min)*
Introduce the design sprint team, determine the “decider” and acknowledge the others involved with the project but not participating in the design sprint.

### Intro to the design sprint process *(5min)*
High Level overview and goals of each day. Set expectations about how we might feel at certain steps in the process.

There are many uses for a design sprint. At the core a design sprint is about quickly and collaboratively using design thinking to solve problems.

### Intro to Day 1: Understand *(5min)*
Day 1 is about developing a common understanding of the context  within which we are working and all the elements in that context (the problem, the business, the customer, the value prop/hypothesis, success, etc). Our goal is to expose risky knowledge gaps and identify risky assumptions so that we can make plans for reducing those risks and move forward confident we are heading in the right direction. Also, by gather info we will empower our decision making abilities and eliminate the need for guesswork later on.

### The challenge statement *(10min)*
Define a concise design challenge. “A Design Challenge is phrased in a human-centered way with a sense of possibility. For example: ‘Create savings and investment products that are appropriate for people living in rural areas.’” - IDEO HCD toolkit

### Introduce Assumptions board *(10min)*
Throughout the day and rest of the week we will ask questions we don’t have answers to and identify assumptions we are relying on. We will capture these ‘Assumptions’ on a board for later organization and analysis.

### Introduce Back-burner board *(10min)*
We will also be generating a lot of ideas throughout the week. Some of the ideas will be pertinent to the tasks at hand, but others, although interesting, won’t be. We will capture these good but not immediately relevant ‘back-burner ideas’ on a sticky note board.

### [Pitch Practice](Pitch Practice Worksheet) *(15min)*

### Existing research *(10min)*
Quickly identify existing research the client has done and determine when that research can be brought back during the definitions section of the day.

### Definitions: The business & The customer *(1hr)*

### Definitions: The problem, The value prop, Success *(1hr)*
[See the problem & the value prop and success worksheets]

### Business Model Canvas *(30min)*
[See business model canvas worksheets]

### Lightning Demos *(45min)*
Analyze three or more competitive or similar products.

### Expert Perspectives *(30min)*
Identify existing research and other perspectives that would provide valuable insights and info.

### Daily Recap *(30min)*
Consolidate notes and write daily summary.
